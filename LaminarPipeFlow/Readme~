In this tutorial we solve for laminar Poiseuille flow through a pipe in OpenFoam
We only mesh a small wedge-section of the pipe and utilize the wedge 
boundary condition to save computational time. 
The case is solved with simpleFoam
Pay extra attention to the entrace length which is given as 
L_E = 0.05 * D * Re_D
And see for example if the solution satisfies this.
